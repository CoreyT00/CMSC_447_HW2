In order to run this program, the user must first establish a few things. The user must have all of the needed framesworks and tools installed such as flask, python3, and sqlite3.
The user must also establish/ create a proper python enironment in order to run the program. The user needs all files that are in the repo. Also the porgram will not work properly if the file named "index.html" is not in a folder called "templates" that is is the same directory as
the "app.py" file. The reason for this to ensure the proper connection bewteen the python flask file and the html file. Once all of this steps have been followed, the user should now be able to excute the program. In order to execute the program, you must open up a terminal. Within the terminal inside of the directory with all of the program files, type the command
"python3 -m flask run" and hit enter. The program will display a link strating with http://. copy and paste that link into a browser and you should have acess to the website and can intercat with the program.
